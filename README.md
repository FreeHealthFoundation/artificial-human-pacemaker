Artificial Human Pacemaker
==========================


Artificial Human Pacemaker

This project is an implementation of the informal specification of a pacemaker provided by Boston Scientific (2007 ). 
The specification is being implemented in accordance with the formal specification in Z proposed by Artur Gomes (2010 ). 


New ! Advanced users read the https://github.com/FreeHealthFoundation/artificial-human-pacemaker/wiki


The project is underway at Free Health Foundation fully indipendently.

The purpose of the implementation is to make a real time Java approach to the development of a real-time 
embedded system. The virtual machine being used is JamaicaVM PE developed by aicas. 
To properly execute this code on your environment you must first install JamaicaVM 6.2 with Exclipse on your machine, 
configure the appropriate JRE ( JamaicaVM 6.2 ). 

Due to the complexity and limitations of resources, the current development version ( alpha) will have only some of the 
components necessary for execution in steady state and without the use of the accelerometer. 


Please Donate and activite partcipate with Free Health Foundation.


How To Use
===========

Download and install that JamaicaVM 6.2 with Eclipse plugin. Download this project. Uncompress. Create a Folder / Directory named pacemaker, under it another Directory name it as src and again another Directory, name it pacemaker. Now move all the files of ths project under :

~ `pacemaker/src/pacemaker/`

You might need to remove the first `pacemaker` directory (root becoming `src` in that case).
